================
To create a unique AI-generated NFT collection inspired by artists like Basquiat and Keith Haring, we’ll need to break the project into manageable components and integrate multiple technologies. Here's a detailed breakdown of the steps and Python code that you might use:
Key Components:

    AI-Generated Art: Use AI models like DALL·E (for image generation) or DeepArt for style transfer to create artwork inspired by Basquiat and Keith Haring.
    Dynamic Pricing Mechanism: As each piece is sold, the price will increase. This can be done via a smart contract or a dynamic pricing function.
    Bitcoin Blockchain Integration (Ordinals): We'll deploy NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain using Ordinals (Bitcoin-native NFTs).
    AI Agents: Twitter and Telegram bots to engage with users and promote the art.
    Luxury Branding: Crafting a narrative around the NFTs with a luxury fashion angle, adding exclusivity to the project.
    Deployment: Implementing the smart contract for dynamic pricing and integrating the bots with the collection.

Below is the structure for how this project might be implemented.
1. AI Art Generation with Style Transfer

You can use OpenAI's DALL·E or a neural style transfer tool to generate unique art that aligns with the Basquiat and Keith Haring aesthetic. Here's an example using OpenAI API to generate AI art.

Install OpenAI Python Library:

pip install openai

AI Art Generation Code:

import openai

# Setup OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = 'your-openai-api-key'

# Function to generate AI art using GPT
def generate_ai_art(prompt, style="Basquiat or Keith Haring inspired"):
    response = openai.Image.create(
        prompt=f"{prompt} in the style of {style}",
        n=1,
        size="512x512"
    )
    
    # Return the generated image URL
    return response['data'][0]['url']

# Example usage
artwork_url = generate_ai_art("Abstract graffiti art", "Basquiat")
print("Generated Artwork URL:", artwork_url)

This will generate an AI image in the style of Basquiat, and you can customize it further. The resulting image URL can be stored as part of the NFT metadata.
2. Bitcoin Blockchain NFT Integration (Ordinals)

Bitcoin does not natively support NFTs like Ethereum does. However, with the Ordinals protocol, you can mint NFTs directly on Bitcoin. Ordinals use Bitcoin's OP_RETURN feature and store the metadata inside individual satoshis (smallest units of Bitcoin).

Install Ordinals Tools:

You will need to set up an Ordinals-compatible wallet and use tools like OrdinalWallet to interact with the Bitcoin blockchain.

Here is a simplified version of what the minting process might look like in Python, assuming integration with Ordinals-compatible wallet.

import requests

# Ordinals minting endpoint (Assuming Ordinals API is used for minting NFTs)
def mint_nft_on_bitcoin(image_url, price):
    nft_data = {
        'image_url': image_url,
        'price': price,
        'metadata': {'collection': 'Luxury Fashion NFTs', 'lore': 'Inspired by Basquiat and Keith Haring'}
    }

    response = requests.post('https://ordinals-api-url.com/mint', json=nft_data)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("NFT minted successfully!")
    else:
        print(f"Error minting NFT: {response.text}")

# Example usage: Minting an NFT with the previously generated artwork URL
mint_nft_on_bitcoin(artwork_url, price=0.1)  # Price increases with each mint

3. Dynamic Pricing Mechanism

Each NFT’s price increases after each sale. This can be implemented by updating a smart contract or using a dynamic pricing algorithm that tracks the number of NFTs sold.

Here’s a simple Python implementation of a dynamic price function:

class NFTCollection:
    def __init__(self):
        self.nfts_sold = 0
        self.base_price = 0.1  # Starting price in BTC

    def get_price(self):
        # Dynamic pricing: Each subsequent NFT is more expensive.
        return self.base_price + (self.nfts_sold * 0.05)  # Increase by 0.05 BTC per NFT sold

    def mint_nft(self, artwork_url):
        price = self.get_price()
        print(f"Minting NFT at price: {price} BTC with art {artwork_url}")
        self.nfts_sold += 1
        # Simulate minting process (this would be linked to actual blockchain logic)
        mint_nft_on_bitcoin(artwork_url, price)

# Example usage
nft_collection = NFTCollection()
nft_collection.mint_nft(artwork_url)
nft_collection.mint_nft(artwork_url)  # The price increases after each mint

4. AI Twitter Bot

The Twitter bot can be created using the Tweepy library, which allows integration with Twitter's API to automate the generation of tweets related to the NFT collection. It can engage users creatively by tweeting art facts, updates, and exclusive drops.

Install Tweepy:

pip install tweepy

Twitter Bot Code:

import tweepy

# Twitter API keys (Set your credentials here)
API_KEY = 'your-api-key'
API_SECRET_KEY = 'your-api-secret-key'
ACCESS_TOKEN = 'your-access-token'
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = 'your-access-token-secret'

auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(API_KEY, API_SECRET_KEY)
auth.set_access_token(ACCESS_TOKEN, ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET)

api = tweepy.API(auth)

def post_tweet(message):
    try:
        api.update_status(message)
        print("Tweet posted successfully!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error posting tweet: {e}")

# Example usage: Posting a creative message about the NFT
post_tweet("New luxury fashion NFT collection inspired by Basquiat & Keith Haring! Exclusive, avant-garde pieces await. #NFTs #Art #Luxury")

5. AI Telegram Bot

The Telegram bot can be built using python-telegram-bot to answer art-related questions and provide updates.

Install python-telegram-bot:

pip install python-telegram-bot

Telegram Bot Code:

from telegram import Update
from telegram.ext import Updater, CommandHandler, CallbackContext

def start(update: Update, context: CallbackContext):
    update.message.reply_text("Welcome to the avant-garde AI-driven NFT collection! Ask me about the collection or the art.")

def info(update: Update, context: CallbackContext):
    update.message.reply_text("Our NFTs are inspired by the unique styles of Basquiat & Keith Haring. Each piece is one-of-a-kind!")

# Set up the bot with your Telegram token
updater = Updater("your-telegram-bot-token", use_context=True)

dispatcher = updater.dispatcher
dispatcher.add_handler(CommandHandler("start", start))
dispatcher.add_handler(CommandHandler("info", info))

updater.start_polling()

6. Luxury Branding for the Collection

Crafting the lore around the collection is essential. You can use the following example text in your marketing materials and metadata:

Example Lore: "The Luxury Fashion NFT Collection is a tribute to the genius of Basquiat and the bold spirit of Keith Haring. With every piece, we celebrate individuality, creativity, and exclusivity. Inspired by high fashion, this collection is not just art—it's an investment in the future of digital luxury."

This can be included in the metadata for each NFT.
Final Notes

    Deployment: Deploy your Python scripts to a cloud service (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean) to ensure they can run continuously for generating and minting NFTs.
    Security: Ensure secure handling of API keys, especially for Twitter, Telegram, and Stripe (if used for payments). Environment variables or vault services like AWS Secrets Manager are essential for this.

This code provides a framework for your AI-driven NFT collection on the Bitcoin blockchain with creative Twitter and Telegram bots. It also includes a dynamic pricing model and branding strategy inspired by luxury fashion.
